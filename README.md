## Planning
Top three most used apps and their features I like:
### Messages
- Sending funny animal emojis
- App store implementation; custom emojis, games embedded within the app
### Chrome
- Main page recent news section
- Auto complete searches
### Discord
- Sending favorited GIFs
- Video/phone calling

## Idea of an app on iOS:
Budget tracking app that is much more simple and concise than others available on the App Store. 
Shows users exactly where money is specifically going, and if it is possible to improve a certain part of 
a budget.
